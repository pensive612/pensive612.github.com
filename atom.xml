    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the companies I&#8217;ve been really interested in lately is
<a href="http://www.parse.com">Parse</a>.</p>

<p>Something about what they do and how they approach it.  And especially how fast it seems they improve themselves.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to try and do a series on my <a href="http://pensive612.github.com/blog/categories/parse/">learnings with Parse</a> mostly because:</p>

<ul>
<li>I was inspired by this position: <a href="https://parse.com/jobs#devevang">Parse Developer Evangelist</a></li>
<li>Writing about my learning will help improve it</li>
<li>Something I learn here might help you on your path</li>
<li>The idea of separating the front-end and your own data API is pretty exciting</li>
</ul>


<p>If you guys have any questions, let me know.</p>

<p>The first thing we should talk about.  Yup.  I saw it too.</p>

<h4>Hellow Orld&#8230;</h4>

<p>But that&#8217;s really the point for me.  I&#8217;m learning.  I&#8217;m doing my best in this
here world just like the rest of us.</p>

<p>And its a good reminder that learning is as much about the mistakes as it is the
right answers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m happy to teach, and I&#8217;m grateful to be taught.</p>

<p>So, lets see how this goes&#8230;</p>

<p><em>Welcome, and hellow orld.</em></p>
