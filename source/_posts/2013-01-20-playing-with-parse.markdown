One of the companies I've been really interested in lately is
[Parse](http://www.parse.com).

Something about what they do and how they approach it.  And especially how fast it seems they improve themselves.

<!-- more -->

I'm going to try and do a series on my [learnings with Parse](/blog/categories/parse/) because:

- I was inspired by this position: [Parse Developer Evangelist](https://parse.com/jobs#devevang)
- Writing about my learning will help improve it
- Something I learn here might help you on your path
- The idea of separating the front-end and your own data API is pretty exciting


I plan on posting my journey through learning about Parse here.

And if you guys have any questions, let me know.
