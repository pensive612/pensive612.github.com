So this is awesome.  Really awesome.

[CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) has gone out and created an [API course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/apis).

I think its going to do really well.  And they were very clever to get big companies
with useful APIs to join in and write mini lessons to use their own APIs.

And what more could I ask for.  [Parse](https://parse.com/) is in there.

Here's the honest feedback so far.

<!-- more -->

I've been doing them in order.  Starting with the general HTTP lesson.  Straight forward
nice.  Made me feel like I have a chance and grasping all this.

Then doing them in order, I got to the YouTube lesson.  Very cool.  They did a good job of
making the Google API not feel intimidating.  And I was able to fly through it pretty quickly.

Second was [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/).  I think this is a really cool project, and I love how they give it all to you in an API.
Promptly got through creating a player, an interface to upload recordings, and view comments in real time.  Awesome.

And here we are Parse.

Ready to get into it.

#### First impression?

Well.  it looks like they're the first of the lessons that I've encountered that is
using their own interface inside the Results window.  Could be cool?!

Wah, wah.  Its super buggy.  And looking at the forums.  People are reporting the same
thing.  I hate that the first chapter has taken me longer than almost any other entire section.

But I have faith that they will fix this.  And when they do.  I'll jump back and edit this.

What they're trying to do is quite complex.  And CodeAcademy is prone to bugs.  So I'll chalk
this up as 'working out the kinks'.

#### Okay, I've gotten past the first section.  Hopefully things clear up on the second.

Doh.  Its the first API lesson that requires you to go and create an account.

I'm guessing the fact that their API is writing data is why they chose not to make a test API key.

Obviously it will probably get them some signups as well.  But it did take actual setup unlike any of the others.
