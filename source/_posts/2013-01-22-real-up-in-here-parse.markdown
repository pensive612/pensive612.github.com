Oh man.  This article was supposed to be called Querying Objects in Parse.  But it looks like
it might be time for a little intervention instead.

*Parse.... CodeAcademy....  Its your friend Adam.*

*I'm stubborn.  I like what I like.  And guess what.  I like you guys.*

*You've given me invaluable education and services.  And haven't asked for anything in return.*

*And its hard to say this, but at least you're going to hear it from a friend.*

Your Parse lesson in the [Learning APIs](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/apis)
course is so buggy, that I'm worried you are actually going to **repel** new and valuable developers.

I have to wander through text, removing tabs, adding them.  Cutting text, adding it back.

Submit.  Run Code.  Submit.  Delete.  Edit.  Read the docs.  Submit again.

All this, and my code was correct the first time.


### Here's where things are going wrong

- The coderunner is crazy buggy.
- The content descriptions for each step were very incomplete, and inconsistent.
- Hints are non-existent or copy/pasted from previous paragraphs.
- You RARELY get an error, and if you do, it is usually not the correct one.
- I've spent no more than 10% of my time in this course actually writing.


### This is my honest advice.

Pull the course until you guys can fix this.  You are souring your own name and reputation
for any new user who is intrigued and putting in the time to learn the API.

The first two courses, [YouTube](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/youtube) and [SoundCloud](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/soundcloud) were seemless.  Piece of cake.

And I know you guys can come up with something awesome.
